  # collect those film API urls, make a web request to each URL to get the info

  # return value of this method should be collection of info about each film.
  #  i.e. an array of hashes in which each hash reps a given film
  # this collection will be the argument given to `print_movies`
  #  and that method will do some nice presentation stuff like puts out a list
  #  of movies by title. Have a play around with the puts with other info about a given film.

## BONUS

# that `get_character_movies_from_api` method is probably pretty long. Does it do more than one job?
# can you split it up into helper methods?
